## REACT STATE
<strong>React State</strong> is a feature in the React JavaScript library that allows developers to manage and store information within a component. State represents the internal state of a component, and can be used to store and update data that may change over time, such as user input or the results of an API request.

The state of a React component can be <em>initialized in the constructor method, and can be updated using the <strong>setState() method</strong></em>. When a component's state changes, React will automatically re-render the component to reflect the updated state.

React State is a powerful feature that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By using state to store and update data, developers can create applications that respond to user input and update in real-time without requiring a full page reload.
