## REACT INLINE STYLING
<strong>React inline styling</strong> is a way to apply styles to React components directly in the JSX code, rather than in a separate CSS file.<br> This approach can be useful for small applications or when a component's styles are specific to that component and do not need to be reused across the application.
<br>
There are a few different ways to apply inline styles in React, of which two are discussed here.<br>
<ol>
<li>One way is to use the style attribute on an element and pass in an object of key-value pairs, where the keys represent CSS properties and the values represent their corresponding values. Examples:<br>
const myStyles = {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    color: 'white',
    padding: '10px'
  };
</li><br>
<li>Another way to apply inline styles in React is to use the {{}} syntax, which allows you to write CSS-like syntax directly in the JSX code. Example:<br>
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white', padding: '10px' }}></li>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p style="color: royalBlue; font-size: 15px; font-family: Script MJ Bold; font-style: italic;">When using inline styles, it's important to remember that the styles are scoped to the component they are applied to and cannot be reused across the application. Additionally, because inline styles are applied directly to the element, they can override any styles that are applied to the element through a separate CSS file or stylesheet.</p>
